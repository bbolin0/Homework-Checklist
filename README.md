# Homework-Checklist
This allows the user to create a list with their homework assignments. They can also perform actions on the list, including deleting tasks, clearing the list, etc.
When you run the file, you are going to be prompted to enter a number depending on what you want to do to the homework checklist. 
Based on the number input, you will either be asked to make more inputs or the new list will be printed. 
It will continue to ask you what you want to do with the list until you press the number 8, which quits the program.
